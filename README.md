# ðŸ¤– Diabetes Classification: Predicting Disease Risk from Health Metrics

![Made with Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Python-blue?logo=python)

This project applies **machine learning classification** techniques to the well-known **Pima Indians Diabetes dataset**, aiming to predict whether a patient is at risk of diabetes based on common health metrics. It highlights how data science can support **early disease detection** and **healthcare decision-making**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Dataset**: Pima Indians Diabetes Database
- **Observations**: 768 patients
- **Features**: 8 medical and demographic variables
- **Target**: `Outcome` (1 = diabetes, 0 = no diabetes)

This case study uses Python and scikit-learn to build, evaluate, and interpret several classification models. The full pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and feature importance analysis.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- **Data Exploration**  
  Visualize and summarize patient health metrics to understand their relationships and distributions.

- **Model Building**  
  Train and compare classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, KNN) to predict diabetes.

- **Performance Evaluation**  
  Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

- **Feature Interpretation**  
  Identify which health variables most influence the likelihood of diabetes.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Technologies

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

### ðŸŸ  Data Preparation
- Identified and handled biologically implausible values (e.g., 0 in glucose or BMI)
- Imputed or flagged missing values
- Visualized distributions, correlations, and outliers

### ðŸŸ  Model Development
- Split data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20)
- Trained classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
- Applied cross-validation for hyperparameter tuning

### ðŸŸ  Model Evaluation
- Evaluated using:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **F1-score**
- Used confusion matrices to assess false positives and false negatives
- Analyzed **feature importance** to understand clinical relevance

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Findings

- **Glucose** and **BMI** are the strongest predictors of diabetes.
- **Age** and **Pregnancies** also show a positive correlation with diabetes risk.
- Best models achieve approximately **75% accuracy**, striking a balance between sensitivity and specificity.
- Feature importance analysis confirms the value of routine measurements for early detection.
